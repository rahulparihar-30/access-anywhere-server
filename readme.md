# üéâ Hacktoberfest Participation

This repository is participating in **Hacktoberfest**! üéÉüçÇ
This repository serves as the **backend** for the **Access Anywhere** application. It is responsible for handling file management operations, secure communication, and real-time synchronization between the desktop and mobile app.

The backend repository can be found here: [Access Anywhere Server](https://github.com/rahulparihar-30/access-anywhere-server)
## üåü Key Features

This application focuses on providing a secure, seamless, and user-friendly experience for remote file management.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: A single codebase for both **iOS and Android** using React Native.
- **Complete File Management**: Securely **browse, upload, download, rename, and delete** files on your remote computer.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Instantly see file changes on your mobile device as they happen on the desktop.
- **Robust Security**: Built with strong **AES-256 encryption** to ensure your data is always protected during transfers.
- **Optimized Performance**: Engineered for **low latency** and includes **offline access** to files you've previously viewed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

The project is built with a modern, scalable technology stack.

- **Frontend (Mobile App)**: **React Native**
- **Backend (Server)**: **Python** with the **FastAPI** framework
- **Communication**: Secure **HTTPS** and **WebSocket** protocols for real-time communication

The system uses a simple client-server architecture where the desktop runs a lightweight Python server, and the mobile app acts as the client to manage files.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- Python 3.8+ & pip
- React Native development environment (Xcode or Android Studio)

### Backend Setup

### Quick Start Guide for Flask API Server

Follow these steps to set up and run the Flask API server locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rahulparihar-30/access-anywhere-server.git
    cd access-anywhere-server
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Server**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Access the API**:
    Open your browser or API client (e.g., Postman) and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    htttp://<your-ip-address>:3000
    http://127.0.0.1:3000
    ```

You're now ready to use the Flask API server for development and testing!

### Frontend Setup

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

This project is actively being developed. Here are some of the planned future enhancements:

- **Enhanced Security**: Implement **end-to-end encryption** for all file transfers to ensure robust security without relying on third-party cloud services.
- **Direct Access Methods**: Replace QR code-based access with a simpler **PIN-based authentication** or **device pairing** for seamless connectivity.
- **Faster File Transfers**: Optimize the file transfer protocol to achieve **high-speed performance** even on low-bandwidth networks.
- **No Cloud Dependency**: Ensure all file transfers and management occur directly between devices, maintaining **complete user privacy**.
- **User-Friendly Setup**: Simplify the initial setup process to make it more intuitive for non-technical users.
- **Customizable Access Permissions**: Allow users to define specific access permissions for connected devices.
- **Cross-Network Connectivity**: Enable file access across different networks using **NAT traversal** or **peer-to-peer connections**.

## üé® User-Friendly UI Enhancements

To ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience, the following UI improvements are planned:

- **Modern Design**: Implement a clean and responsive UI using **Material Design** principles for a consistent look and feel across devices.
- **Dark Mode**: Provide a **dark mode** option for better usability in low-light environments.
- **Drag-and-Drop Support**: Enable **drag-and-drop functionality** for file uploads and organization.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Add **onboarding tutorials** to guide new users through the app's features.
- **Customizable Themes**: Allow users to personalize the app with **custom themes** and color schemes.
- **Accessibility Features**: Ensure the app is accessible to all users by adding **screen reader support**, **high-contrast mode**, and **scalable text sizes**.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Display **real-time notifications** for file transfers, errors, and updates.
- **Search and Filters**: Introduce a **search bar** and advanced **filtering options** to quickly locate files.

These enhancements aim to make the application more engaging and user-centric. Feedback is always welcome to further refine the user experience!
